# Functionality

This is an AI-powered productivity app designed to help you work with focus, structure, and accountability. At its core, the app guides you through your day by helping you define your goals, breaking them down into manageable tasks, and organizing those tasks into Pomodoro-style work sessions. Unlike traditional productivity tools, this app is adaptive â€” after each session, it checks in to see what you accomplished, how focused you felt, and adjusts your remaining schedule based on your actual progress, energy, and any new tasks that may have come up.

But the app goes beyond solo task management. It integrates powerful accountability features through body doubling: you can choose to work alongside a prerecorded video of someone else working or join live video sessions with a partner. In live mode, you and your partner begin each interval by stating your intention out loud and end it by standing up and affirming your commitment, reinforcing ownership and presence. For collaborative workflows, the app offers collab-sessions, allowing two or more users to work on the same task in real time, with optional breakout segments for individual focus.

At the end of the day, the app compiles your session data into a clear, personalized summary that helps you understand your focus patterns, task completion rates, and areas for improvement. Whether you're working alone or with others, it creates a structured yet flexible environment that helps you show up, stay focused, and finish the day with clarity and purpose.

## Core Features

### 1. Adaptive Task Management

This app transforms traditional task management by combining goal-setting with adaptive Pomodoro sessions. Users define their goals and break them down into manageable tasks that are organized into focused work intervals. What makes it unique is its adaptive nature - after each session, it conducts check-ins to assess completion, focus levels, and energy. The system then automatically adjusts your remaining schedule based on actual progress, accommodating new tasks that may arise and optimizing your workflow in real-time.

### 2. Accountability Framework

The app enhances productivity through structured accountability features. Users can choose between working alongside pre-recorded videos of others working (passive body doubling) or engaging in live sessions with partners. In live mode, sessions begin with verbal intention-setting and conclude with physical affirmations, reinforcing commitment. For team projects, collab-sessions enable multiple users to work on shared tasks simultaneously, with options for individual focus periods through breakout segments, creating balanced collaborative workflows.

### 3. Performance Analytics

The system compiles comprehensive data from your work sessions into personalized end-of-day summaries. These reports provide valuable insights into your focus patterns, task completion rates, and areas for potential improvement. This data-driven approach helps users understand their productivity trends over time, enabling more informed decisions about work habits and scheduling. Whether working independently or collaboratively, the tracking features create a framework for continuous improvement and self-awareness about personal productivity.

## Work Modes

The app offers three distinct work modes to accommodate different productivity needs and preferences:

### Solo Mode

In Solo mode, you work independently while watching a prerecorded video of someone else working. This passive body doubling creates a sense of shared focus without direct interaction. You maintain accountability by checking in with the AI assistant at the beginning and end of each work interval, stating your intentions and reporting on your progress.

### Witness Mode

Witness Mode connects you with another user via live video. While each person works on their own individual tasks, the shared virtual presence creates mutual accountability. Each interval begins with both partners stating their intentions out loud and ends with standing up and verbally affirming what was accomplished, reinforcing commitment through social accountability.

### Collab Mode

Collab mode is designed for two or more users working on the same task together. This mode includes collaborative intervals where users actively work together, interspersed with optional breakout intervals for individual focus. During collaborative segments, participants hold each other accountable, while during individual breakout periods, accountability shifts to the AI assistant. This creates a balanced workflow that combines the benefits of teamwork with focused individual effort.

## Terminology

The app uses specific terminology to describe its core productivity concepts:

**TODO**

> Something that needs to be done. TODOs represent work items that you need to accomplish, ranging from quick single actions to more complex undertakings.

**Objective**

> Larger piece of work or goal that may require multiple intervals or even sessions to complete. Objectives provide the big-picture view of what you're working to accomplish and can be broken down into smaller, more manageable tasks.

**Task**

> Discrete piece of work that can either contribute to completing an objective or exist as a standalone item. Tasks are designed to be completable within one or a few intervals. A single interval can accommodate work on multiple related tasks, allowing for flexible progress toward your objectives or addressing independent work items.

**Backlog**

> Collection of all TODOs, objectives, and tasks that need to be addressed. The backlog serves as a centralized repository of work items that can be prioritized, scheduled, and tracked over time.

**Session**

> Complete work period for the day, consisting of multiple work intervals. Sessions are designed to help you structure your entire day's productivity with appropriate breaks and transitions between focused work periods.

**Interval**

> Pomodoro-style unit of focused work time, typically lasting 25 minutes followed by a short break. Each interval has a specific focus and intention, and the app guides you through completing intervals throughout your session.

**Check-In**

> Evaluation point at the end of each interval where you report your progress, focus level, and energy to the AI assistant. These check-ins help adapt your schedule in real-time based on your actual performance and needs.

**Recap**

> End-of-day summary that compiles all session data, including completed tasks, focus patterns, and accountability metrics. The recap provides insights into your productivity trends and helps you plan for future sessions more effectively.

## User Flow

The app guides users through a structured workflow that optimizes productivity while maintaining flexibility. The flow consists of three main phases:

### 1. Planning

The planning phase establishes your objectives and organizes your work:

a. TODOs are gathered via user input or from the backlog
b. TODOs are split into objective-specific or standalone tasks
c. Tasks are distributed across intervals to create a balanced schedule

### 2. Execution

The execution phase is where focused work happens:

a. Committing to work on specific tasks during an interval
b. Working on the tasks with focused attention
c. Reporting on task achievement through check-ins
d. Ad-hoc refinement of upcoming interval planning based on progress and energy levels

### 3. Reflection

The reflection phase helps improve future productivity:

a. Reviewing insights related to overall performance and potential improvements
b. Preparing planning elements for the next session
c. Updating the backlog based on completed and remaining work
