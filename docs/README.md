# Summary

This AI-powered productivity app helps you work with focus, structure, and accountability. It guides you through planning your day, executing focused work intervals, and reflecting on your performance.

### Core Features

#### Adaptive Task Management

The app transforms task management through adaptive Pomodoro sessions. You define goals, break them into manageable tasks, and organize them into focused work intervals. After each session, it conducts check-ins to assess completion and focus levels, then adjusts your remaining schedule based on actual progress and energy.

#### Guided Focus Sessions

Three distinct work modes provide structured accountability:

**Solo Mode**: Work independently while watching a prerecorded video of someone else working, with AI-assisted accountability.

**Witness Mode**: Connect with another user via live video. Each person works on their own tasks while maintaining mutual accountability through verbal intention-setting and affirmations during breaks.

**Collab Mode**: Work with others on the same task, with collaborative intervals and optional breakout intervals for individual focus.

#### Performance Analytics

The app compiles data from your work sessions into personalized summaries, providing insights into focus patterns, task completion rates, and areas for improvement. This enables better decisions about work habits and continuous improvement.

### User Flow

#### 1. Planning

- Gather TODOs from user input or the backlog
- Split TODOs into objective-specific or standalone tasks
- Distribute tasks across intervals for a balanced schedule

#### 2. Execution

- Commit to specific tasks during each interval
- Work with focused attention
- Report on achievements through check-ins
- Ad-hoc refinement of upcoming intervals based on progress

#### 3. Reflection

- Review performance insights and identify improvements
- Prepare tasks for the next session
- Update the backlog with completed and remaining work

### Terminology

**TODO**: Something that needs to be done, from quick actions to complex undertakings.

**Objective**: Larger piece of work requiring multiple intervals or sessions to complete. Provides the big-picture view of what you're working to accomplish.

**Task**: Discrete piece of work that contributes to an objective or exists standalone. Designed to be completable within one or a few intervals.

**Backlog**: Collection of all TODOs, objectives, and tasks that need to be addressed.

**Session**: Complete work period for the day, consisting of multiple intervals with breaks and transitions.

**Interval**: Pomodoro-style unit of focused work followed by a short break.

**Check-In**: Evaluation point after each interval to report progress, focus level, and energy.

**Break**: Short rest period between work intervals, designed to refresh mental energy and prevent burnout. During breaks in Witness Mode, users may engage in verbal intention-setting and affirmations.

**Recap**: End-of-day summary of session data, tasks completed, and productivity insights.
