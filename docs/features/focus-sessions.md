# Focus Sessions

> Focus Sessions are structured work periods that provide accountability and help users maintain productivity. Sessions are organized into intervals with post-interval check-ins to track progress and optimize your schedule.

## MVP Implementation

- Independent work with prerecorded video and AI-assisted accountability (Solo Mode)&#x20;
- Check-in after each interval for users to report task progress and completion status
- AI-assisted adjustments to remaining schedule based on actual progress

## Future Enhancements

- Assess focus level during the interval during check-in
- Picture-in-picture mode for playing video&#x20;
- Track energy levels during intervals
- Enhanced AI support in Solo Mode with clearer user guidance
- Evaluation of video implementation options (peer-to-peer vs. bot/work-with-me videos)

**Witness Mode**

- Live video connection with another user for mutual accountability
- User matching functionality based on time slots, activities, or preferences
- GDPR/consent information and reporting functions for inappropriate behavior

**Collab Mode**

- Collaborative work intervals with optional breakout sessions
