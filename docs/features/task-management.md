# Task Management

> Adaptive task management helps users define goals, break them into manageable tasks, and organize them into focused work intervals, with check-ins after each session to assess completion and focus levels.

## MVP Implementation

* Task creation (smallest interval) and organization functionality
* Goal breakdown into actionable tasks
* Focused work interval organization
* Option for different interval durations
* Post-session check-ins to assess completion and focus (TRACKING)

## Future Enhancements

* Integration with calendars and task management tools
* Eat the frog (neurotypical) vs. interest based brains&#x20;
* Biorhythm (Eule vs. LÃ¤rche)
* Reminders for incomplete tasks or unachieved goals
